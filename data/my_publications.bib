	abstract = {The Minnesota Family Investment Program appears to stabilize monthly household incomes of
participating families. The analysis below explores the considerable income instability for all new
families enrolling in the program from 2013 to 2016, and makes clear that families’ incomes, without the
program’s cash grants, vary to a degree that it would be almost impossible for a family to know from
one month to the next if they had the income to cover expenses. Overall, 44\% of families in the program
experience extreme income instability, where in any month they have over a 30\% chance to have zero
income or twice their average monthly income. Minnesota Family Investment Program grants create a
floor of available resources so families are unlikely experience a month with no income. The program
provides families a much more stable total household budget.},

	abstract = {Minnesota’s Self-Support Index score and range uses statistical analysis to measure participant success in the Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP) and Diversionary Work Program (DWP). As supervisor, the state uses the Self-Support Index to measure performance of county agencies and other local providers on these programs. The Minnesota Department of Human Services (department) is responsible for maintaining and improving the Self-Support Index to be an accurate predictor that fairly holds local agencies accountable.
In spring 2017, several changes were made to the Self-Support Index to more accurately predict county and local agency performance, and better control for factors outside of their control. These changes were made to the logistic regression model used to predict participant success on the Self-Support Index and include five new variables, two interactions between variables, and new treatment for missing data. The Research Unit, Economic Assistance and Employment Services Division, Minnesota Department of Human Services, used data from the fourth quarter of 2016 cohort of the Self-Support Index to test these changes.
One new variable is an indicator for gender of the participant. Men make up 20 percent of participants in this cohort and are positively correlated with success on the index. Men and women have different labor market outcomes, which suggests that including gender in the model will improve its accuracy. While investigating the gender variable, Research Unit staff observed correlation with a variable that identifies participants that are part of two-adult cases. Almost 75 percent of male participants are part of two-adult cases. Interacting gender and two-adult case variables allows the model to better predict outcomes.
Four new variables measuring county-level child care availability are included. Many local agencies identify child care as a key constraint on MFIP participants. Child care options allow parents to seek work.
The second interaction added to the model combines indicators for being an immigrant and needing interpreter services. More than 58 percent of immigrants need interpreter services, and almost 94 percent of those who need interpreter services are immigrants. Testing the interaction, staff found that all immigrant participants, and participants who need interpreter services, are more likely to be successful on the index than non-immigrants who do not need interpreter services.
Staff also investigated how to account for missing data. Four variables tend to have missing data in the Self- Support Index: adult age, age at first birth, diagnosis of chemical dependency, and diagnosis of a mental health condition. Historically, the average of existing data for these variables was replaced for participants with missing data. For the age variables, this is a fair decision and should not bias the model. There is less justification for this procedure for health diagnoses, as there is no practical meaning for a fraction of a diagnosis. Investigating participants with missing data, researchers found that missing age at first birth and health diagnoses are positively correlated with success on the index. Department staff employed a new treatment for missing data where the means for age and age at first birth was used to replace missing values for those variables, and missing variables for health diagnoses were replaced with zero, indicating that no positive diagnosis exists. In addition, three new indicators were included in the model identifying when a participant had missing data for age, age at first birth, and health diagnoses.

Testing models with new variables under different data treatments shows that a full model, including variables for gender, child care availability, and missing variable indicators, and replacing missing age and age at first birth with cohort means, and missing health diagnoses with zeroes, produces the most accurate Self-Support Index model. The sum of misses from predicted and actual scores of local agencies are minimized with this model, and the number of local agencies falling in their ranges is maximized. These changes in the Self-Support Index model were implemented in the first quarter of 2017 cohort of the index.},
